# should have the default table name be configurable
# don't really need to namespace the 'flavor' column; it's already polymorphic
# don't need to override has_one since we just made our own pretty method
# auto-generate the migration for the One True Table
# need to reflect to override the associations
# should require validation of flavor; we could even make sure it's one of the indicated flavors
  by tracking associations

# should have these by default on the Upload model
